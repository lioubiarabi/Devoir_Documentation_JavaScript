# variables

## Variables : var, let, const

We use them to store data, and use them later by calling them by their names. They all can contain the same data types: string, number, boolean, object, array, functions...

**var:** it can be use globaly, we can redeclare it again, when we declare it for the first time it assigned as undefined

for example: 

`var name = "arabi"`

---

**let:** it has the block scope so we can use it in its block `{}`, we can redeclare it again in its block, when we declare it for the first time but calling it is after assigning a value to it

for example: 

`let age = 50`

---

**const:** it has the block scope, we can't redeclare it again, when we assign it the value rest constant

for example: 

`const pi = 3.14`
